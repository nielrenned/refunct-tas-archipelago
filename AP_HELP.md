## Archipelago
This is a quick file to introduce you to Archipelago. Also see https://archipelago.gg/

Archipelago is a multiworld randomizer, where items from multiple games can be combined into one itempool to create a massive randomizer!

The games connect to a server and items are sent around automatically!

## How to play single-player Refunct with Archipelago
Refunct is a "custom game", which means it's not on the website yet.

Refer to [this text](https://archipelago.gg/tutorial/Archipelago/setup_en#playing-with-custom-worlds) for more info. 

Here's my summary of how to play:
- Download Archipelago: https://archipelago.gg/tutorial/Archipelago/setup_en
- Open the ArchipelagoLauncher. Click `Install APWorld` and install the refunct.apworld that you can find in my [Refunct release](https://github.com/spinerak/refunct-tas-archipelago/releases/latest).
- Download the Refunct.yaml from my release. Open it in a text editor and in it you can change your name. Put this file in the Players folder.
- In the launcher, press Generate to generate your game.
- In the launcher, press Host to host your game. Pick the output zip that was just generated.
- Your login information is now `localhost:38281,YourName`. You will need this to login to Archipelago.
- You're now good to follow the Refunct specific instructions.

## How to play multiworlds
- There's plenty of games with the installation, you can find more custom games in the Archipelago discord (in the form of apworld files). Install all apworlds of custom games you want.
- Add one yaml file for every game you want to add. yaml files will also contain the options per game that you can change.
- Press generate. Instead of clicking 'Host' in the launcher, go to https://archipelago.gg/uploads and upload your output zip.
- When you create a room, you should see the address of it, for example `archipelago.gg:12345`. Follow the Refunct specific instructions with `archipelago.gg:12345,YourName`.
